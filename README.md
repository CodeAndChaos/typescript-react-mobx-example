When looking around for example applications that use [Mobx 5.x](http://mobx.js.org) combined with [Mobx-react 5.x](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react) and [TypeScript 3.x](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) I did not find any useful example. Most of the examples in the [awesome mobx list](https://github.com/mobxjs/awesome-mobx) reference Mobx 3.x and are really outdated.

In my example I will use MOBX to display "Hello World!". It should showcase a couple of core concepts you will be using in an mobx application.
